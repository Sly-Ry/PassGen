# PASSGEN
## A personal JavaScript development project.

This is a randomized password generator that prints anywhere between 8-128 characters using letters(lower&uppercase English alphabet), numbers(0-9) and special characters.

I wanted to create a site where a user could create a personalized password for themselves in case they couldn't create one for themselves.

## Installation
click the link to pull up the website - https://sly-ry.github.io/PassGen/
(As of right now, PassGen is only available through GitHub)

## Usage
The screen should load with the following image:

When the user clicks the "Generate Password" button, they are presented with a series of prompts for password criteria to include in the password.
This includes:
- Length of the password (at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters)

- Lowercase letters

Once all prompts are answered, a password is generated that matches the selected criteria and is displayed onto the page:

If the user doesn't enter a number between 8 & 128 for the length of the password, they are presented with an error message:

If the user doesn't pick any criteria to include in their password, they are presented with an error message:
- ![Screenshot (11)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93052960/147858024-ea04d3e8-0466-4677-95bc-fa5cd4a385b1.png)
